# BizReach

  

BizReach is an online platform used to connect nearby mobile businesses to customers in need of their services. It allows users to browse a variety of different services and businesses to view local customers in need of their services. Payments can be made directly on BizReach, which offers a simple and secure transaction.

The primary motivation of BizReach is to help customers easily find reliable businesses who are in need of their service without doing hours of research. We also strive to help talented small business owners gain a clientele without spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on advertising. 

BizReach is built using React, Firebase, Node.js and Express. FERN has been chosen as the framework to construct this app because of its potential to create high-quality web applications with a single codebase, regardless of the OS of the device. This stack is also relatively easy to learn for developers with experience with object-oriented programming languages like Python, Java, etc and provides. Firebase also provides an authentication service which will be integrated in the platform
