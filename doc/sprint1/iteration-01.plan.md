All roles and responsibilities are not limited to be done by one specific member. Each of us has our own skills but we all ensure the project is organized and all project deadlines are met.


### Events

We plan to have meetings every day online via Discord. We may skip some stand-ups if there is not much to discuss. Each stand-up will be transcribed and summarized and posted on Slack.

The purpose of each meeting is to discuss everyones progress on their respective tasks.

Coding sessions, code reviews, and other events are spontaneous. These meetings are scheduled during the daily stand-up.

### Artifacts

We utilized Jira as our product management tool to organize and track progress. Jira lets us create a backlog of tasks that need to be completed. During our stand-ups, we collaboratively determine what tasks should be prioritized within the current sprint. After weâ€™ve defined the tasks for the sprint, each team member has the opportunity to select the tasks they will work on.

### Goals and tasks

For this iteration, our goal is to implement the signup and log-in feature for BizReach. Since our platform has two types of users, we want to ensure the signup feature works for both service providers (businesses) and service seekers(customers).

The tasks we need to complete to meet our goals:

- As an unregistered user, I want to be able to easily register so I can access the list of services available to me.
- As a user, I want to be able to log out of my account, so I can use another account if I need to
- As a business owner, I want to register as a business account, so I can sell my services to those who require them


### Artifacts

To produce our project idea, we are building a static website, pushing it to our GitHub repo so we can utilize our platform anytime and anywhere. Artifacts that we produced to ensure the platform is created are:
- Wireframes and Mockups: Low-fidelity representations of the website's layout, structure, and user interface.
- Design Attributes: Design assets such as logos, colour schemes, and other visual elements used to create a consistent and appealing design.
- Front-End Code: JavaScript and CSS code that implements the website's user interface and behavior. 
- Back-End Code: Javascript code that implements server-side functionality and data storage/retrieval.
- Flow Diagrams: To ensure backend logic flows smoothly with the frontend design.
