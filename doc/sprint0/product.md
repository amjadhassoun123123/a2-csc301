#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We're creating a mobile app to connect users needing various "come to me" services with businesses offering those skills, in an Uber-like interface. Our app will be a dynamic marketplace for "come to me" services like home repair or IT support. Users can post jobs detailing their needs and budget, while businesses can browse and accept jobs. This is allows users to pay what they think is fair, and businesses to freely pickup jobs they find fit. A typical use case might be a user needing professional moving services, or their yard done. We plan to include a rating and review system for quality control and customer satisfaction for both users and businesses. At this stage, we're focusing on what the product does, leaving implementation details for the development stage.


#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

End Users: This group comprises individuals or groups who are in need of "come to me" services. They range from homeowners requiring maintenance or landscaping, to office administrators seeking IT assistance, or students in need of tutoring. Their priority lies in accessibility, promptness, excellence of service and flexibility.

Solo Service Providers: This category includes skilled individuals in search of flexible work opportunities. They can be independent contractors offering home maintenance, IT freelancers, or individual tutors, among others. These users are drawn to the possibility of examining and choosing jobs that align with their skill set, availability, and preferred compensation.

Business Service Providers: This group encompasses businesses that provide an array of services such as professional movers, landscaping companies, or IT support firms. They find benefit in reaching a broader spectrum of potential clients and the autonomy to select jobs that match their operational capacity and specialty. Our app's review mechanism also offers them a chance to improve their brand image and foster trust among customers.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Presently, End Users have to look through multiple sources, make several phone calls, compare prices, and usually depend on personal recommendations when seeking service providers. This approach is not only tedious but also leaves the quality of service to chance; you want a good service and you will find it, eventually, bu at what cost? Our product steps in to address these issues by offering a single platform where users can detail their job requirements,budget and timeline, peruse various service providers, and choose based on ratings and reviews. This process not only conserves their time but also enables them to select the most suitable provider for their needs.

Independent Service Providers, at present, must advertise their services on various platforms, personal contacts, or on freelance job sites. The uncertainty of job availability and compensation rates for independent workers has always been an issue. Our product introduces a continuous flow of job opportunities that they can sift through and accept as per their expertise, availability, and desired compensation. This not only enhances their ability to secure jobs but also allows them to have better control over their workload and earnings. With the rating system, contractors will be compensated for their good work , and customers will see who truly provides good services.

For Business Service Providers, acquiring new clients usually demands significant marketing efforts and high client acquisition expenses. Our platform provides them access to a broader pool of potential clients at a considerably lower cost, boosting their operational effectiveness and profitability. Additionally, our review system enables them to cultivate a reputable brand and establish trust with customers, which can be daunting with conventional advertising techniques.

To conclude, our product delivers a more streamlined and efficient solution for all parties involved. It saves time, enhances the discovery of jobs and services, and fosters a platform for a better and more open exchange of services.


#### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team 

We can decide when a implementation or feature is done by passing it by the group. Testing functionalities is the most important part of a group  project, so being able to implement a feature, and having others review it is a must. This removes any bias and allows for more rich and diverse ideas and edge cases to come to fruition. When the group can firmly say this feature fits its description, accomplishes all necessary steps and outputs correctly consistently, we can agree it's done



### Highlights
 
Throughout our meetings and collaborative process, we have arrived at several key decisions and insights that have shaped our product and team dynamics:

Dual Review System: We mulled over the idea of how to ensure the quality of services being provided and came to the conclusion that a dual review system was essential. We recognized that a single-sided review system, where only the service receivers rate the providers, would not be fair to all users on the platform. We wanted to validate good service providers and also give them the opportunity to review their clients. This mutual feedback mechanism will promote a healthier marketplace environment. The dual review system was unanimously agreed upon as it ensures transparency and holds both parties accountable.

Communication Platform: Selecting a communication platform that was convenient for all team members was a significant decision. We considered various alternatives like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Discord. Since all of us have previously taken computer science classes together, we had already used Discord for communication and found it efficient and familiar. As such, we decided to continue using Discord for our project discussions and meetings.

Defining "Done": We agreed that for a feature or implementation to be considered "done", it needs to be thoroughly tested and reviewed by the team. Considering the alternatives of individual or selective group testing, we decided that a collective approach would ensure diverse ideas and edge cases being covered. This also removes any bias that might influence the testing process.

Meetups: Our team collaboration process involved regular meetups in class, where we discussed progress, addressed any issues, and planned next steps. The advantage of knowing each other from previous classes was that we already had a level of comfort and understanding, which made these meetups productive.

Product Focus: In terms of product decisions, we initially considered focusing on a few specific service categories. However, upon discussion, we realized the potential of our platform to be a dynamic marketplace for "come to me" services across multiple categories. This would offer our end-users a broader range of services to choose from and service providers a larger pool of potential clients.

These decisions have played a pivotal role in shaping our current product plan and team process. We've ensured to choose options that make the most sense for our team, product, and end-users, always prioritizing efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity.
