# BizReach/cd-user-baddies


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 7th, 2023
 * Where: Online - Discord call 

## Process - Reflection

BizReach is an online platform used to connect nearby mobile businesses to customers in need of their services. In this file, we will discuss our insights into the first sprint of creating BizReach. We will discuss our plan before the sprint, our plan during the sprint, and how we can improve our plan for the next sprint.

#### Decisions that turned out well

 * Cleaning code base: This was the highlight of our developmental process. After our first sprint, our code base was a mess. Thankfully before committing to implementing new features, we decided to clean up our code. This really helped us implement to features in the long run.
 * Creating more detailed responsibilities: This allowed each of us to focus on our specific jobs more closely and more importantly it allowed us to hold each other accountable.
 * Using Chakra UI: We don't have much frontend expertise or any idea on how to make a website look good. So, using Chakra UI was a savior for us.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * Not having enough sprints. Although this wasn't planned, it still was a decision that hurt us. It caused a lot of stress to complete simple items within out deadline.


#### Planned changes


 * We plan to start being more formal with all documents and meetings that come forward. We had missed some stand-ups this sprint and it will not happen again.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Posting job, ensuring the post link is only available for the customersâ€™ NavBar
 * Discovering posts, ensuring the Discover page is only available to businesses.
 * Improving login page UI
 * Creating a better register page, with a prompt for more information
 * Improving Register Page UI
 * Improving Post Page UI
 * Improving Discover Page UI
 * Allowing a business to send a message to the customer. We will not implement the entire messaging feature. We just want to enable businesses to send one message so the entire workflow for posting and accepting a gig between users is clear.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Profile page UI improvement. This was not completed because we just didn't have time to get to it as the profile page had gone through major changes. We feel the UI can easily be improved in the next sprints.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Continue having consistent stand-ups. We need to make sure we have the minimum number of stand-ups per sprint so development goes smoothly.
 * Keep improving UI. Although we improved some UI design we will still continue improving the design so our final product looks beautiful.
 * Messaging Feature. Our main goal is to implement the messaging feature for businesses and clients to interact.
