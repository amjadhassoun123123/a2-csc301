## Iteration 02

 * Start date: June 23rd, 2023
 * End date: July 7th, 2023

## Process

Our process starts with a initial meeting at the start of the sprint. During this meeting we explicitly outline goals and tasks we want to complete during this iteration. We also outline what went wrong during the last sprint and how we can improve. Next, we start the sprint on our jira and add the relevant tasks to be completed. We each pick the tasks we want to complete and start working on them. We usually dont have stand ups until the week before the stand up is due so each member has something to show and all blockers/merge conflicts and other issues can be dealt with before the demo.

#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

Cleaning up code base: This change was the most important. During iteration-01 we had changed our tech stack from flutter to MERN, so our code base was a mess due to us rushing to meet the deadlines. At the start of this sprint, we cleaned up the backend code and now it much more readable and easy to navigate through. This one change makes implementing and changing feature much easier.

Outlining responsibilities: Another significant change that made our developmental process much easier was outlining everyones responsibilities. So, if a task needs to be completed it can be done by the person who is responsible for it. For example, Aneeq is in charge of the Jira, so any changes needed to be done will be handled by him, the rest of us can focus on our responsibilities.





#### Roles & responsibilities

Harshil - Frontend & backend, focusing more frontend 
Aneeq - Frontend & backend, focusing more backend
Amjoud - Frontend & backend, focusing more backend
Majed - Frontend & backend, focusing more backend
Anas - Front & backend focusing on both

Aneeq manages the Jira and github repo. Anas ensures the code base isn’t filled with unnecessary coding (E.g commented out code), he also ensures we’re using best practices. Majad focuses on the UI and design of the platform. Amjad rigorously tests and fixes the backend if he finds any issues. Harshil manages all documents required for the sprint and helps with UI design.



#### Events

We plan to have meetings every day online via discord. We may skip some stand ups if there isn’t much to discuss. Each stand up will be transcribed and summarized and posted on slack. Most stands up happen during the last week of the sprint, since everyone has something to show for by then.

The purpose of each meeting is to discuss everyones progress on their respective tasks, discuss blockers and make sure we accomplish our goals for the sprint.

Coding sessions, code reviews and other events are spontaneous. These meetings are scheduled during the daily stand up.

#### Artifacts

We utilized jira as our product management tool to organize and track progress. Jira lets us create a backlog of tasks that need to be completed. During our stand ups, we collaboratively determine what tasks should be priortized within the current sprint. After we’ve defined the tasks for the sprint, each team member has the opportunity to select the tasks they will work on.









#### Git / GitHub workflow

Since we discuss what tasks each member will be working at the start of the sprint, we have an idea of who is going to be coding where and where a potential conflict may emerge. We start by creating a branch with a detailed name that clearly outline what feature will be worked on in the branch, then once the branch is ready to be merged into main we create a pull request. The pull request is then sent into out Discord server and is reviewed by a member that is also working on the same files the PR contains. If the PR doesn’t include any files anyone else is working on, it can be picked up by anyone. Merge conflicts are handled together on a call, so no ones work is lost. We chose this workflow because it ensures everyone is up to date on how other members’ changes may impact them and it also makes sure no ones work gets lost. 


#### Goals and tasks

For this iteration our main goal is to implement the basic workflow of a customer posting a job and a business accepting the job. During the process the business will be able to send a message to the customer. Another goal we will accomplish is improving the UI with respect to the feedback we received from the last sprint (make it visually appealing and removing links that aren’t meant for the user type).

Items we want to implement in order:

Posting job, ensuring the post link is only available for the customers’ NavBar
Discovering post, ensuring the discover page is only available to businesses.
Improving login page UI
Creating a better register page, with prompt for more information
Improving Register page UI
Improving Profile page UI
Improving Post Page UI
Improving Discover Page UI
Allowing a business to send a message to the customer. We will not implement the entire messaging feature. We just want to enable businesses to send one message so the entire workflow for posting and accepting a gig between users is clear.


#### Artifacts

To produce our project idea, we are building a static website, pushing it to our github repo so we can utilize our platform anytime and anywhere. We also have developed low fidelity prototypes of our project idea so, our frontend designers are on the same page. We produce and design some of our own images such as logos to enhance the visibility aspect of our platform.
